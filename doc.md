### Frontend (React)

1. **Login.jsx**: 
   This component is responsible for the login functionality. It displays a form for users to input their email and password. Upon form submission, it should make an HTTP POST request to the backend to authenticate the user. However, in the provided code, it incorrectly uses a GET request, which should be changed to POST for securely transmitting sensitive information.

2. **App.jsx**: 
   This is the main component in the React application. It sets up the routing using `react-router-dom`, defining paths for the home page, registration page, and login page. It also configures Axios, which is used for making HTTP requests, setting the base URL to the backend server and enabling credentials to be sent with requests, which is necessary for session or authentication token handling.

### Backend (Express.js)

1. **authControllers.js**: 
   Contains the controller functions for authentication-related endpoints. The `test` function sends a JSON response indicating the endpoint's functionality. 

2. **authRoutes.js**: 
   Defines the routes for authentication purposes, linking them to their respective controller functions. It employs CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware to allow the frontend, served from a different port, to make requests to the backend.

3. **index.js**: 
   The entry point of the Express server application. It initializes the application to use the defined routes and starts the server listening on a specified port. CORS is used here to handle cross-origin requests, and the authentication-related routes are set up to be accessible from the root path.

## How the token stuff works
1. **React Context (UserContext)**
   Context Creation: UserContext is created to globally manage and share the user's state across the React application.
   State Management: Within UserContextProvider, a useState hook (user, setUser) is used to maintain the current user's state.
   Effect Hook: useEffect is used to perform a side effect â€” fetching the user profile when the component mounts or the user state is null.
   
2. **Determining Login State and Retrieving the User**
   When the application (or component using UserContextProvider) loads, useEffect triggers a GET request to the /profile endpoint.
   
   This request is made with credentials (axios.defaults.withCredentials = true), which means cookies are sent along with the request.
3. **Backend Handling (getProfile)**
   The server receives the GET request at the /profile endpoint.
   
   It then attempts to extract the token from the request cookies (req.cookies.token).
   
   If a token exists, it uses jwt.verify to validate this token using the secret key (process.env.JWT_SECRET).
   If the token is valid, the user's information encoded in the token is returned as part of the response and then set in the user state by setUser(data) in the useEffect hook.
